# About the Challenge

In this challenge, we will practice using HTTP clients to consume the GitHub API in order to create a personal blog. The application will use the GitHub API to fetch issues from a repository, data from your profile, and display them as a blog.

- Display your profile with an image, number of followers, name, and other information available through the GitHub API.
- List and filter all the issues from the repository with a brief summary of their content.
- Create a page to display a complete post (issue).

Despite having only a few features, you will need to recall concepts such as:

- Fetch / Axios
- Routing and React Router DOM
- Forms

For this application, we provide a layout for you to follow and implement all the functionalities designed in Figma. [https://www.figma.com/file/5yT9ZzZmRQRS4yivGGB3pl/Coffee-Delivery/duplicate](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1138814951106121051)
